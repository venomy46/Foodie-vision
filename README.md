⚙️ How It Works

The user uploads a food image through the web interface

The FastAPI backend receives and processes the image

Food is detected using predefined logic

Recipe data (ingredients and cooking steps) is generated instantly

The frontend displays results with animated UI components

Users can read, listen to, or watch cooking tutorials
